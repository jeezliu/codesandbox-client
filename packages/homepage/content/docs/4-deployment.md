## Integrations

In order to be able to deploy your app, you need to access the Preferences menu and select the Integrations tab. Log into your ZEIT account and it's all set.

## Deployment

Go to any of your sandboxes, click in the Deployment menu (the rocket icon in the sidebar) and click in "Deploy Sandbox" and then in "Deploy Now" and that's all. You will see an URL to your app after a few seconds.
